# 🛠️ Offensive Security Tools & Techniques

Whether you're a student, a CTF player, or a working security professional — this project is designed to help you discover, understand, and organize the landscape of offensive tools effectively.

---

## 🔧 Purpose

This repository is NOT a collection of walkthroughs or cheatsheets.Instead, it is a **structured catalog** that:

- Groups hacking tools by functional categories
- Highlights usage contexts and links to external resources/labs
- Serves as a starting point for learning and using each class of tools
- Helps with training, teaching, and internal knowledge sharing

## 📂 Categories Covered

Each entry is grouped into a **functional category** of offensive security:
